# Python Chatbot Service using LangChain and PGVector

## Project Overview
This repository hosts a proof of concept for a chatbot service built with Python. It uses FastAPI to expose the service, the LangChain library for managing functionalities, and PostgreSQL with the PGVector extension for storing and retrieving embeddings generated by OpenAI's API.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- PostgreSQL
- PGVector extension installed in your PostgreSQL setup

## Features
- **API Interaction**: Exposes an API for interacting with the model.
- **Test Page**: Includes a `/test` route that provides a *very* simple interface to try out the assistant.

## Installation
You can set up this project using Docker or by manually setting up your environment.

### Using Docker
1. Build from the Dockerfile with environment variables set up.

### Manual Setup
1. Clone the repository.

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd your-repository-name
   ```
3. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Add the environment variables to a `.env` file in the `src` folder.
5. Start the service:
   ```bash
   uvicorn src.main:app
   ```

## Usage
Once the service is running, you can interact with the chatbot via the API or the test page at the `/test` route.
